# Reference architectures and solution ideas

We welcome contributions to the [Power Platform and Copilot Studio Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/architecture/). 

1. If you want to contribute an article to the Architecture Center, register your work before you start to reduce the risk that someone else is working on the same architecture.  To register your work, submit a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/issues/new?template=new_architecture_submission.yml).
1. The GitHub repo contains Word templates that you can use to capture your contribution. All Word templates are in the [https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/tree/main/templates/architecture](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/tree/main/templates/architecture) The folder also contains a PowerPoint template and a Visio template that can help you design the diagrams you need. Alternatively, use your own diagrams.
1. When you're ready to submit a new article, attach the files to your GitHub issue and change the label to *ready for review*. Optionally, add your LinkedIn profile so that you can be listed as the original author in the *Contributors* section of the article.
